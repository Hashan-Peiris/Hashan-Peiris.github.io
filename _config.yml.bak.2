# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: >
  I am a computational materials scientist and engineer with experience spanning both academia and industry. My research involves advanced simulations (DFT, AIMD, ML) to solve real-world challenges in batteries, catalysis, interfacial chemistry, and materials design—resulting in multiple publications and funded proposals. I’ve worked hands-on in large-scale manufacturing, inspection, and failure analysis in the chemical, energy, and automotive sectors. I’m recognized for interdisciplinary collaboration, technical mentoring, and effective project management within high-performing research and industrial teams.
